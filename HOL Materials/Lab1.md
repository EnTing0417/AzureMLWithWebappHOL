# 1. Make an Azure Machine Learning (ML) Experiment

In this lab, we will make an Azure Machine Learning experiment that trains a model to predict car prices.

# Five steps to create an experiment

# Create a model

Step 1 : Get the data

You may upload your own dataset in .csv format or use sample dataset in azure ML Studio.For this particular experiment, we will use 
Automobile price data (Raw), that's included in your workspace. This dataset includes entries for various individual automobiles, including information such as make, model, technical specifications, and price.

Extra knowledge - 
[Upload the dataset to Machine Learning Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio/walkthrough-2-upload-data) 


Step 2 : Prepare the data 

Step 3 : Define the features 


#  Train the model 

Step 4 : Choose and apply a learning algorithm

# Score and Test the model 

Step 5 : Predict new automobile prices
